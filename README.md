# InkGlow

InkGlow adds a subtle glow effect to newly typed text, which gradually fades away.  

## Features

- **Animated Glow Effect** - New text glows momentarily before returning to normal.
- **Adaptive Styling** - Glow is reactive to your theme’s text color and appearance mode. 
- **Customizable Duration & Intensity** - Settings tab allows control of how long and how bright the glow lasts.
- Also works with copying and pasting text.
