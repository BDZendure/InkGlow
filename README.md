# InkGlow

InkGlow adds a subtle glow effect to newly typed text, which gradually fades away.  

## Features

- **Animated Glow Effect** - New text glows momentarily before returning to normal.
- **Adaptive Styling** - Glow is reactive to your theme’s text color and appearance mode. 
- **Customizable Duration & Intensity** - Settings tab allows control of how long and how bright the glow lasts.
- Also works with copying and pasting text. 

## Installation

1. Go to your Obsidian plugins folder (`./obsidian/plugins`) and run:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BDZendure/InkGlow.git
```
2. Build dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
npm run build
```
3. Restart the app if necessary and enable InkGlow under Settings → Community Plugins → Installed Plugins → InkGlow.
